# nvim-gc

My personal neovim configuration, built with lua.

After fighting with several neovim configuration templates for a long time, finally I decide to build my personal sets.

In order to solve the problems I met while using templates, this built follows following characteristics:

1. low-level
2. low update frequency
3. those plugins I really needed
4. those settings I really needed

Keep clean and simple, don't aim to become an IDE but neovim/vim itself.
